# vite-vue3-mail-experiment

This is my first attempt to mess up with vue 3 composition API, based on the homonym [vue mastery course](https://www.vuemastery.com/).

The web dev is [Vite 2.0](https://vitejs.dev/) a great ultra lean / blazing / fast next-gen frontend tooling which is build on top of ESmodules.

`npm run dev` to run the project.

`json-server --watch db.json --port 8000` (or whatever port you like) to run the json server.

Enjoy <3
